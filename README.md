## Resources
Detailed guides and examples can be found in the repository [object-oriented-programming](https://github.com/acs-aburada/object-oriented-programming). 
This repository will be updated yearly to be synced with the latest C++ standard agreed upon for the OOP course, as well as the predetermined curricula 
of the latest academic year.
